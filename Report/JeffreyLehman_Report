  -Initial palnning for design and interface
- Programming
  - Had a hand in almost everything but the user interface, not the most artistic
    - BroadcastReceivers
    - Clover functionality
    - Intent research and implementation
    - All database creation and upkeep in SQLite
    - Code upkeep (documentation and cleaning up useless statements)
    - A lot of debugging, Log.d all over the code to create almost a verbose type of error detecting
    - SMS research and implementation over several types
